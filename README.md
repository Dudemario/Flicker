# LightSwitch
Flicker is an internet of things (IoT) light system which will make quarantine life more convenient and help save electricity.

Flicker uses a servo motor and a wifi microcontroller to help you turn on or off the lights from the tip of your fingers. Let’s say you want to take a nap during the day or your in an online class and don’t want to get up. Well with Flicker, you don't need to get up to close the lights and instead just click a button on the web application. In addition to removing an inconvenience, Flicker will also help you save electricity. The web application can be controlled anywhere in the house so if you forget to turn off the lights in your room, just let Flicker do it for you.

Please see the code above for the light switch and the source code for the React app. Here is a video demo of the light switch:https://youtu.be/Qbar9h9sFiI
